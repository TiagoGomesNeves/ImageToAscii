## Image to Ascii 
Allows you to change an image into the its ascii representation

# Setup 
Clone the repository

Install dependencies with: 

`pip3 install pillow` 

Run the code with:

`python3 asciiImage.py [Image name]` 

example: 

`python3 asciiImage.py Pikachu.jpg`

This turns this image of pikachu:

![](Pikachu.jpg)

![](asciiPikachu.png)
 
**Note**: Works best with small pictures and make sure the image and asciiImage.py are in the same PATH
